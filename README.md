okay so, you might be wondering what this is. this was originally meant to be a personal script hub for me and some friends, but i've decided to make it public as of 06/04/2022 since someone found it and forked it, which now that i think about it, i should've made this public a long time ago. if you want we have a discord which is https://discord.gg/2dz3BRDWuJ which is also where we list every supported game, however if you don't want to join it, there's still game lists in the official discords of the hubs, or their official pages.

script is:

loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fheahdythdr/legendary-train/main/Script%20Hub%20Selection.lua"))()

credits are in the main hubs.

if you're the creator or owner of one of the scripts or hubs and want credits, dm me on discord (discord is oogabooga#7914) and i'll add it, just specify which hub your script is in as the two hubs have different scripts.

feel free to make pull requests or ask for a certain script to be added

i check the discord alt i put here every now and again, don't expect an immediate response

if you do make your own script from this, please do not just outright repost the ui scripts (as in, atleast add a script or two, don't just repost the script hub selection thing)
